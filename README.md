# Cursor Agent Chat Manager (ccm)

`ccm` is a terminal UI manager for **`cursor-agent`** (or cursor cli) chats (terminal-only). It helps you:

- Discover folders that have **cursor-agent chat sessions**
- Browse folders + sessions in a responsive **TUI** with a **preview pane** (message history)
- Resume a selected session via **`cursor-agent --resume <chatId>`**

This project targets **macOS** and **Linux**.

## Requirements

- Python **3.7+**
- Cursor installed
  - [Cursor](https://cursor.com/download), [Cursor CLI](https://cursor.com/cli)

## Install

### One-line install (GitHub Releases binary)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baaaaaaaka/cursor_cli_manager/main/scripts/install_ccm.sh | sh
```

This will:

- Detect your OS/arch and download the matching `ccm` bundle from GitHub Releases
- Extract it into `~/.local/lib/ccm` and create symlinks in `~/.local/bin`:
  - `ccm`
  - `cursor-cli-manager`

Tip: for stability/security, pin the installer to a tag (or commit SHA):

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/baaaaaaaka/cursor_cli_manager/v0.6.7/scripts/install_ccm.sh | sh
```

Notes:

- You can override the GitHub repo via `CCM_GITHUB_REPO=owner/name`
- Choose install dir via `CCM_INSTALL_DEST=/some/dir`
- Choose bundle install root via `CCM_INSTALL_ROOT=/some/dir`

After installing:

- If installed via **binary**, you will have `ccm` and `cursor-cli-manager`
- If installed via **pip**, you will have `ccm` and `cursor-cli-manager`

### From Git (recommended)

```bash
# HTTPS (recommended)
pip3 install "cursor-cli-manager @ git+https://github.com/baaaaaaaka/cursor_cli_manager@main"

# or pin to a commit:
pip3 install "cursor-cli-manager @ git+https://github.com/baaaaaaaka/cursor_cli_manager.git@<commit_sha>"
```

### From source

```bash
git clone https://github.com/baaaaaaaka/cursor_cli_manager.git
cd cursor_cli_manager

pip3 install -e .

cd ..
rm -rf cursor_cli_manager
```

## Run

After installing as a package:
```bash
ccm
# or
cursor-cli-manager
```

Or from the repo root:

```bash
python3 -m cursor_cli_manager
```

## TUI controls

- **Navigation**: Up/Down, PageUp/PageDown
- **Switch pane**: Tab / Left / Right (Workspaces → Chats → Preview)
- **Search**: `/` then type, Enter apply, Esc cancel
- **Open**: Enter, or double-click a row with the mouse
  - Select **`(New Agent)`** at the top of a workspace to start a brand-new terminal chat in that folder
- **Quit**: `q`
- **Preview scroll** (when Preview pane is focused): Up/Down, PageUp/PageDown (mouse wheel best-effort)
- **In-app update**: `Ctrl+U` (works for **GitHub-release binaries** and **pip VCS installs with PEP 610** metadata)
- **Mouse**: click to select (wheel support is best-effort and may be unavailable on some `curses` builds)

The bottom-right corner shows version/update info:

- `vX latest`: update check succeeded and you are up to date
- `vX`: update check unavailable (e.g. not installed via PEP 610 VCS)
- `vX Ctrl+U upgrade` (bold): update available

## Commands

- `ccm tui` (default): interactive TUI
- `ccm list`: print discovered workspaces and chat sessions as JSON
  - `--with-preview`: include last message preview (slower)
  - `--pretty`: pretty-print JSON
- `ccm doctor`: print diagnostics about detected `cursor-agent` storage + CLI
- `ccm open <chatId> --workspace <path>`: resume a chat session in the terminal
  - `--dry-run`: print command instead of executing
- `ccm upgrade`: upgrade in-place (GitHub-release binary or PEP 610 VCS install)

Note: global flags must come before the subcommand:

```bash
ccm --config-dir <dir> doctor
```

## Tests

```bash
python3 -m unittest discover -s tests -p 'test_*.py' -v
```

## Configuration (optional)

- `CURSOR_AGENT_PATH`: override the `cursor-agent` executable path
- `CURSOR_AGENT_CONFIG_DIR`: override the config dir (default: `~/.cursor`)
- `--config-dir <dir>`: override the config dir (same effect as `CURSOR_AGENT_CONFIG_DIR`)
- `CCM_PATCH_CURSOR_AGENT_MODELS=1`: patch cursor-agent bundles before launching so `/model` / `--list-models` prefer "AvailableModels" (best-effort)
- `CCM_GITHUB_REPO=owner/name`: override the GitHub repo used by `ccm upgrade` for GitHub-release binaries
- `CCM_CURSOR_AGENT_VERSIONS_DIR`: override the cursor-agent `versions/` directory (used for model patching)
- `CURSOR_AGENT_VERSIONS_DIR`: same as above (fallback)

You can also run the patch explicitly:

```bash
ccm patch-models
```

## Versioning policy

Starting from **v0.5.0**, **every change must bump the version** in both:

- `pyproject.toml` (`[project].version`)
- `cursor_cli_manager/__init__.py` (`__version__`)

## Notes

- UI chrome is **English-only**. Session titles and previews are shown as stored/extracted.
- Workspaces are keyed by `md5(cwd)` in `~/.cursor/chats/<hash>/...`, which is not reversible. `ccm` auto-learns
  a best-effort mapping and stores it in `~/.cursor/ccm-workspaces.json` (or your overridden config dir) so
  “Unknown (<hash>)” entries can become real folder names after you run `ccm` in that folder once.
- The TUI hides workspaces whose mapped folder no longer exists.
- We intentionally avoid third-party dependencies; everything uses the Python standard library.
